Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. Despite its simple rules, the Game of Life can produce complex patterns and behaviors.

## Rules

The game is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells. Each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead.

1. **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive in the next generation.
2. **Survival**: A live cell with two or three live neighbors remains alive in the next generation.
3. **Death**: In all other cases, a cell dies or remains dead in the next generation.

These rules create fascinating patterns and structures, from simple still lifes and oscillators to gliders and spaceships that move across the grid.
